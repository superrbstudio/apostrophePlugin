20090630: 

The following API calls have changed:

getSelectedItem and getSelectedItems no longer take a $key argument
(the second argument has been removed). Your code will need updating.

The following app.yml settings have been moved:

app_a_media_site has been replaced by
app_aMedia_client_site. This is a single place to specify the
media server this particular site is a client of. Both the CMS and
other applications can transparently use this site without the need
to pass additional arguments. If it is not specified the media API
assumes the media server is part of the same site.

Similarly, app_a_media_apikey haas been replaced by
app_amedia_client_apikey.

The aMedia/info API action has been changed:

The aMediaIds argument has been changed to ids.

Many additional arguments are supported to allow the implementation of a
full browser in client code (see the documentation).

The returned results are now formatted differently:

array("total" => X, "items" => items)

Where X is the total number of items matching the specified criteria, and items is an array of items as returned previously. If you are passing an array of ids you can expect to get all of those items back in the items array provided they exist and are accessible. If you are using other browse criteria, in particular 'offset' and 'limit', you may get back only a subset of the items. Also, future versions reserve the right to limit the number of items returned in a single call, in which case 'total' will still indicate the total number of items that would be returned if there were no limit.

20090510: you'll need a new field in your database:

ALTER TABLE a_media_item ADD COLUMN embed varchar(1000);

In version 0.5 the media repository moved from web/media-items to 
web/uploads/media_items for consistency with other writable folders
in web space. Version 0.5 comes with a different set of rewrite rules
and routing rules. 

We recommend using them.

However, we also realize that you may have an existing project with
a substantial amount of content and you may not be in a position to change
paths which are already serialized in the database. This is true for
one of our own projects. The following are our notes on how to 
override the 0.5 settings and force the 0.2 behavior for paths
and routes.

Those upgrading from version 0.2 of the media plugin will 
need to turn off the default routing rules of the plugin:

all:
  aMedia:
    routes_register: false

And supply these rules manually to keep the old web/media-items behavior:

a_media_info:
  url: /media/info
  param: { module: aMedia, action: info }

a_media_select:
  url: /media/select
  param: { module: aMedia, action: select }

a_media_index_type_tag:
  url: /media/:type/tag/:tag
  param: { module: aMedia, action: index }
  requirements: { type: '^(image|video)$' }

a_media_index_tag:
  url: /media/tag/:tag
  param: { module: aMedia, action: index }

a_media_index_type:
  url: /media/:type
  param: { module: aMedia, action: index }
  requirements: { type: '^(image|video)$' }

a_media:
  url: /media
  param: { module: aMedia, action: index }

a_media_image:
  url: '/media-items/:slug.:width.:height.:resizeType.:format'
  param: { module: aMedia, action: image }
  requirements: { slug: '^[\w\-]+$', width: '^\d+$', height: '^\d+$', resizeType: '^\w$', format: '^(jpg|png|gif)$' }

a_media_image_original:
  url: '/media-items/:slug.original.:format'
  param: { module: aMedia, action: original }
  requirements: { slug: '^[\w\-]+$', format: '^(jpg|png|gif)$'};

a_media_image_show:
  url: '/media/view/:slug'
  param: { module: aMedia, action: show }
  requirements: { slug: '^[\w\-]+$' } 

a_action:
  url:   /cms/:module/:action

a_page:
  url:   /:slug
  param: { module: a, action: show }
  requirements: { slug: .* }

You will also need to override the following directory settings
in app.yml:

  aToolkit:
    # Force the use of the old directory locations for
    # backwards compatibility
    upload_media_items_dir: "SF_WEB_DIR/media-items"
    writable_zend_indexes_dir: "SF_DATA_DIR/zendIndexes"
    writable_persistent_uploads_dir: "SF_DATA_DIR/persistent-uploads"
    writable_tmp_dir: "SF_DATA_DIR/a-tmp"
    indexes:
      - 'HandbookArticle'
      - 'aMediaItem'
      - 'aTubesArticle'
      - 'aTubesEvent'
      - 'aPage'

Finally, do not update your rewrite rules in .htaccess as described in the
README if you wish to keep using the web/media-items folder.
