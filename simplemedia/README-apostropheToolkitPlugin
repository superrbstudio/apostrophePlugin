== Introduction ==

apostrophePlugin can be used by itself and is also part of a suite of plugins that make up the [Apostrophe Content Management System](http://www.apostrophenow.com/). The philosophy of Apostrophe is that editing should be done "in context" whenever possible.

== Overview ==

apostrophePlugin is a collection of useful classes implementing common
routines and algorithms we otherwise find ourselves reinventing in
nearly every application. 

The golden rules for inclusion in apostrophePlugin
are simple: it should be something that PHP and/or Symfony should have had 
in the first place, and the implementation shouldn't be hugely complicated 
or have major dependencies on other libraries not typically built 
into PHP 5.2.x unless the feature (such as Zend Search) is overwhelmingly
useful in the majority of projects. In cases such as Zend Search, it 
is still possible to use all of the non-search-related features of aToolkit
without the need for the Zend library. 

apostrophePlugin classes generally contain straightforward static public
methods. They are grouped in classes in order to gain the benefits of 
autoloading and keep the PHP namespace uncluttered.

apostrophePlugin also contains a collection of jQuery-based JavaScript
progressive enhancement functions in its web/js folder. For more information 
about progressive enhancement in general, see 
[this alistapart article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement).

Since these are not loaded unless you expressly bring them in, there is no 
significant overhead for those not using them. 

For the time being, see the comments in the code for documentation.
