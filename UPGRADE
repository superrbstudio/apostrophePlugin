Upgrade Notes

2009-07-27:

ALTER TABLE a_page ADD COLUMN engine VARCHAR(255);

This statement is necessary to accommodate the new "engine" feature, which greatly
improves the extensibility of the CMS. Symfony modules can now be grafted into the
page tree at any point, using normal actions and templates and otherwise-normal routes
of the aRoute class. See README for details.

2009-05-10:

The slot/area version control feature now displays a very brief 
summary of the changes in each version. This is generally limited
to the first 20 characters added and/or removed in that update,
but this is often enough to remind the user as to what the
purpose of the change was.

This works for custom slot types too as long as they implement
getSearchText() in a reasonable way. It helps to include line
breaks at logical points in your search text.

As a result you'll need an ALTER TABLE statement:

ALTER TABLE a_area_version ADD COLUMN diff varchar(200);

And you'll need to rebuild your Doctrine model classes:

symfony doctrine:build-model
symfony cc

2008-04-07:

Privileges for editing pages and privileges for managing pages
(adding and deleting them) are now managed separately. If you are
already using the app_a_edit_group feature to grant
editing privileges to certain users within certain parts of the site,
you'll need to decide whether to extend add/delete privileges to
those users as well via app_a_manage_group and the 
new multiple select element that has been added to the page settings
dialog. See the manual for more information about the changes.

Those upgrading installations created between March 30th, 2009 and
April 7th, 2009 should execute the following SQL statement to 
add ON DELETE CASCADE to the a_lucene_update table
so that outstanding indexing requests don't break the "delete page"
feature:

ALTER TABLE a_lucene_update ADD FOREIGN KEY (page_id) REFERENCES a_page(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

2008-04-30 (updated 2008-04-07):

Those updating existing installations created prior to the svn version
of March 30th, 2009 will need a new table and an ON DELETE CASCADE
foreign key constraint for it:

CREATE TABLE a_lucene_update (id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT, page_id INT, culture VARCHAR(7), INDEX page_and_culture_index_idx (page_id, culture), INDEX page_id_idx (page_id), PRIMARY KEY(id)) ENGINE = INNODB;

ALTER TABLE a_lucene_update ADD FOREIGN KEY (page_id) REFERENCES a_page(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

For the new Lucene-based search features to work you will also need
to set up a new cron job. For the search index to be brought up to date
every ten minutes, use:

0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /path/to/your/project/symfony a:update-lucene

Synchronous lucene search index updates are for the birds - they slow
down editing and create consistency problems with Doctrine's caching
mechanism which are extremely difficult to debug. If cron jobs are a 
problem for you, trigger this task via system() from a PHP page that
is hit periodically.
