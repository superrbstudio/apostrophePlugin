This is just a quick demo of a slot type that uses a Symfony 1.2 form with 
validation. If you bring this into your actual project you'll need to copy 
Fvtest.class.php from lib/forms to lib/forms of your application, adjust
your schema as described below, and copy fvtest to your application's
modules folder.

(Note that you can also deploy slot types as Symfony plugins.)

Symfony doesn't actually search lib/forms inside a module folder like 
this one. But I don't expect you to activate this module as-is
anyway (it works, but has no practical purpose). It's just a code sample.

The schema.yml settings required are:

fvtestSlot:
  inheritance:
    extends: aSlot
    type: column_aggregation
    keyField: type
    keyValue: 'fvtest'
