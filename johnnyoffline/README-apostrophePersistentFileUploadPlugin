# apostrophePlugin

## The Problem 

When you make a mistake completing a form, Symfony presents the form again,
with all of your previous selections intact, and points out the error
so that you can painlessly correct it... unless one of the form fields
is a file upload field.

In that case, you're stuck browsing for the file again and *waiting for it
to be uploaded again*. And if you don't fix all of your validation errors
on the first try, you may have to do this more than once. Ouch!

Symfony's forms framework presents forms to you again with the same 
values by setting the `value` attribute of each `input` element. However,
for security reasons, web browsers don't honor this when the form
element is a file upload element. That would allow hackers to create
forms with hidden file upload elements that specified the path to any
file on your hard drive... and actually get that file as a result.

And even if browsers did allow it, you would still be uploading the
file over and over again. Far from ideal.

## The Solution

When you use the aWidgetFormInputFilePersistent widget class and
the aValidatorFilePersistent validator class, this problem magically
goes away: file upload fields become persistent through multiple
validation passes. If the user doesn't specifically upload a new file
on a later validation pass, their previous valid upload 
is simply used again... without the need to retransmit the file, and without
the need for the user to browse for it again. 

## Requirements

* Symfony 1.2
* apostrophePlugin

And, optionally:

* apostrophePlugin

If you wish to enable the image-preview option while adding the widget, which displays a thumbnail 
of successfully uploaded image files while the user completes additional validation passes
over the form.

That's it. You do not need to use any particular ORM
because the persistent cache of file uploads is implemented via the filesystem. 

## Installation

Newly uploaded files are copied to a subfolder of your project's
`data` folder called `a-writable`, which is created for you
if it does not already exist. Note that if the permissions of your
`data` folder do not permit this, you'll need to manually create the
`data/a-writable` folder and make sure it is readable, writable and 
executable by the web server. Creating this one folder will take care
of the non-database data storage needs of all P'unk Avenue plugins.

Note that 777 permissions are only appropriate when your web server
runs as a user who otherwise can't touch any files (standard in most Symfony hosting environments):

    mkdir data/a-writable
    chmod 777 data/a-writable

apostrophePlugin will create and chmod this folder for you automatically if you run the
standard `./symfony project:permissions` task.

If you are using the image-preview feature, a `web/uploads/uploaded_image_preview`
will be automatically created to hold the previews, which are automatically aged off
as needed, just as the persistent upload folder's contents are.

You can override the full filesystem path to this directory by setting `app_aToolkit_upload_uploaded_image_preview_dir`. If you do so, you must also override the corresponding web path by setting `app_aPersistentFileUpload_preview_url`. If you don't understand this, just use the defaults, which work great as-is.

## Usage

Here's a simple example with image preview, allowing JPEGs only in this case:

    // In the configure() method of your form
    $this->setWidget('file', new aWidgetFormInputFilePersistent(array("image-preview" => array("width" => 600, "height" => 400, "resizeType" => "c"))));
    $this->setValidator('file', new aValidatorFilePersistent(
      array("mime_types" => array("image/jpeg"))));

You can pass all of the usual options to both the widget and
the validator. This particular example accepts only JPEG images.

Note that you should not enable the `image-preview` option unless you are expecting
only image files.

The `image-preview` option takes an array containing the following parameters:

* `width`: the width in pixels of the preview image.
* `height`: the height in pixels of the preview image. If `height` is `false`, the height will be scaled automatically to match the aspect ratio of the uploaded image. When this feature is used, the `resizeType` parameter has no effect.
* `resizeType`: the cropping style. If `resizeType` is set to `s` or not specified, the image will be scaled up to fill the specified rectangle as much as possible without distortion or cropping. If `resizeType` is set to `c` the image will be scaled up to fill the specified rectangle completely without distortion, cropping as necessary to achieve that goal.
* `forceScale`: by default an image is never scaled larger than actual size, no matter what options are passed. To override this behavior, specify `forceScale = true`. Note that this will certainly result in pixelated images.
* `markup`: by default the preview image is rendered in a very simple `img` element. If you need something else, specify the `markup` option. The URL of the image will be substituted where `%s` appears in your markup string.

You can also specify a filesystem path to an existing image file to be displayed as the default preview if the user hasn't yet uploaded a new one as part of a validation pass. In this way you can show the user the image that is already in the system unless and until they select another. To do that, set the `image-preview` option to the filesystem path of the image. It will be scaled by apostrophePlugin, so it's fine to specify the path to a large original.

## Telling the User What's Going On

This is great stuff, but if the user doesn't realize it's
happening, they may think they are required to select and
upload the file again on each validation pass. You can
fix that by specifying the `existing-html` option
when you create the widget.

If a file has already been submitted on a previous
validation pass, the HTML you specify in `existing-html` will
be rendered *before* the rest of the widget. Otherwise, it won't be
rendered at all.

Here's an example:

    // In the configure() method of your form
    $this->setWidget('file', new aWidgetFormInputFilePersistent(
      array('existing-html' => '<p>You have already uploaded a file.' .
        'Use the browse button if you wish to replace it ' .
        'with a different one.</p>')));

The `existing-html` message will only be rendered if the file validated
successfully on the previous pass. 

If you are using additional
custom validators that take the file into account,
then the persistent file input widget won't
be aware of that, so write your `existing-html` message in such a way as
to avoid confusion if there are errors present as well. Most developers
will never run into this situation.

## Things To Be Aware Of

In order to make file uploads persistent, it was necessary to add
a facility to temporarily store those file uploads to the 
`aValidatorFilePersistent` class.

For security reasons, uploaded files are stored in temporary files with
randomly-generated names. We *never* blindly trust the filename uploaded
by the user (and you'd better not do that either). 

Every time a new file is uploaded, the code also checks the existing
persistent upload files in the `a-tmp` folder. Any files older than one
hour are removed at this point. If this folder grows too quickly for
comfort, you can adjust the time limit by setting 
`sf_persistent_upload_lifetime` via `settings.yml`. Note that the time 
limit is set in minutes.

Since the validator has no knowledge of whether the rest of the form's
fields will validate it must add every new upload to the cache,
even the one that is ultimately part of the final, successful validation
of the form. That's OK because, an hour later, that copy will be
"aged off" along with any abandoned uploads still in the cache.

The persistent file upload widget actually outputs two input elements,
taking advantage of PHP's support for associative arrays just as
the sfWidgetFormInputDate and sfValidatorDate widgets do. When the
widget outputs a file element named `file[newfile]` and a hidden
element named `file[persistid]`, the validator is able to receive these
as a single associative array with `newfile` and `persistid` keys. The
validator then passes either `newfile` or the cached previous upload
indicated by `persistid` as the value given to the `clean` method of
the parent class. This allows the persistent file widget class to stay
lightweight and reuse as much of the `sfWidgetFormInputFile` class
implementation as possible.

## Related Issues

While this plugin was not intended to solve the following related problems,
they are almost always encountered in the same projects. So I thought
I'd take a moment to give some tips from experience.

### What About sfWidgetFormInputFileEditable?

sfWidgetFormInputFileEditable solves a different problem. That widget
is useful when you want to have the option of completely removing the file 
associated with an existing object that is already stored in your database via
Propel or Doctrine.

### Replacing the File Associated With an Existing Object

Many developers also want to be able to optionally replace the uploaded file
already associated with an existing object, without requiring the user
to pick a new file every time. There must be a file, but the user should
be allowed to pick a new one. This comes up a lot in code that manages
media and so on.

This isn't really the issue this
plugin is intended to solve, but it is closely related, so if you're reading 
this there's a good chance you're interested in the solution to that 
problem too. Consider this code from the `configure()` method of a 
Doctrine or Propel form class:

    $this->setWidget('file', new aWidgetFormInputFilePersistent());
    $this->setValidator('file', new aValidatorFilePersistent(
      array("mime_types" => array("image/jpeg"), 
        "required" => (!$this->getObject()->getId()))));

Here I am setting the `required` option of the validator only 
for brand-new objects that haven't been saved at least once already
(they don't have an ID yet).

Now, in the execute method for the action, we need to pay attention to 
whether the user actually uploaded a replacement file and not 
clobber the existing file if they chose not to do so:

    $parameters = $request->getParameter('myform');
    $files = $request->getFiles('myform');
    $this->form->bind($parameters, $files);
    if ($this->form->isValid())
    {
      $file = $this->form->getValue('file');
      // The base implementation for saving files gets confused when 
      // $file is not set, a situation that our code tolerates as useful 
      // because if you're updating a record containing an image you 
      // often don't need to submit a new one.
      unset($this->form['file']);
      $this->form->save();
      $object = $this->form->getObject();
      if ($file)
      {
        $file->save($object->figureOutWhereItShouldBeSaved());
      }
    }

Notice that I grab the value of the `file` field, then `unset`  
that field in the form so that the base class implementation won't
try to save the file for me and get confused if no file was selected.
I then call the save method of the form and retrieve the saved object. 
Finally, if the user did submit a new file, I save it where I want it. 
If they didn't submit a new file, I leave the existing file alone.

Note that this code will work fine whether you choose to use the regular
file widget or my persistent version. 

### What about a progress meter?

A "real" file upload progress meter isn't practical at least in PHP 5 because 
PHP scripts don't start executing until uploads are already complete, meaning
there's no way for your PHP code to communicate any progress indication
to your page. 

But knowing what percentage of the file has been transferred isn't as
important as knowing that the transfer hasn't failed altogether. 

Users are often confused by the lack of obvious feedback during long file 
uploads. They think the page is "timing out" and don't understand that large 
files take a long time to transfer.

The most common workaround, which is found on many major file upload sites,
is simply to display an animated GIF as an activity indicator. But there's
a catch: as soon as your form is submitted, the page goes blank waiting for
new content from the server. Your animated GIF is no longer visible.

The solution for that problem is to embed your file upload form action in
an iframe. The animated GIF lives in the parent document, not in the
iframe. In the onSubmit handler, call a JavaScript function in the parent 
document that makes the animated GIF visible (hint: 
`window.parent.functionname()`). . Then return true so that the
upload can progress normally. In the template displayed in response to the 
file upload, just execute more JavaScript code that hides the
animated GIF again.
