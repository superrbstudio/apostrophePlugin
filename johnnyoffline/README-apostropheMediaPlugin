== READ THIS NOTE FIRST ==

This is a beta release of apostrophePlugin. Although the
media plugin already works quite well and we have launched several production
sites based on it, certain aspects are still maturing.

== Quick Start ==

You can find a complete and fully configured example in the cmstest project, which we use as a starting point for all of our own production sites. If your goal is to add media slots to our CMS plugin, you should start from the cmstest project, which can be easily duplicated in your own svn repository. See apostrophePlugin/README for more information about the cmstest project and how to duplicate it in your own repository.

apostrophePlugin can be used by itself and is also part of a suite of plugins that make up the [Apostrophe Content Management System](http://www.apostrophenow.com/). The philosophy of Apostrophe is that editing should be done "in context" whenever possible.

== Overview ==

aMedia provides five key services:

* A front end user interface for browsing, uploading, 
and managing media (still images and video). 

* A front end user interface for selecting media and then returning
the user to a specified URL within your application, passing on information 
about the selection the user made. 

* A simple, RESTful API that accepts a query for information about one
or more media items and returns everything your application needs to
know about them in an easily understood JSON response. 

* Efficient, 100% cached access to media that resides directly in the
plugin (that is, all still images, and the thumbnails of videos). 
"100% cached" means that with the help of a few Apache directives
these images will come directly from static files once they are
first requested in a particular form.

* Video and still image slideshow "slots" for use with our
CMS solution for Symfony, apostrophePlugin. These slot implementations
are great demonstrations of the selection interface and the API. But not
everyone will want them, and we didn't want to make this plugin
dependent on the CMS plugin. So they are kept in the separate plugin 
apostrophePlugin.

The media plugin is designed to be useful in three situations:

* In the Symfony application in which the media plugin resides;
* In other Symfony applications accessing the media plugin via its APIs, and
* In web applications that aren't written in Symfony, or even in PHP. These
can also use the APIs to take full advantage of the plugin.

We've focused most of our attention thus far on the first two scenarios,
but due to our use of REST and JSON there is no reason why you can't
utilize the media plugin from a separate site written in Ruby on Rails,
or even .NET for that matter.

We'll break down how to use each of these features in turn. But first,
let's make sure the requirements have been met.

== Requirements ==

apostrophePlugin requires:

* Symfony 1.2
* Doctrine
* apostrophePlugin
* apostrophePlugin
* sfJqueryReloadedPlugin
* sfDoctrineActAsTaggablePlugin
* apostrophePlugin
* Zend Search
* FCK (provided in apostrophePlugin, but you must enable it)
* Support for http URLs in fopen() calls ( allow_url_fopen must be set to "on", which is typical ) 

=== Installing the Required Plugins ===

We recommend picking these up painlessly via svn externals. (If your projects 
don't live in a subversion repository, you have our sympathies, and our
firm encouragement to look into that immediately. Trust us, you want
modern version control.)

Make sure you create the necessary symbolic links from your web folder
to the web folders of the various plugins:

    cd web
    ln -s ../plugins/apostrophePlugin/web apostrophePlugin

And so forth for each plugin that has a `web` folder.

Please note that apostrophePlugin also requires that you install the 
netpbm utilities (free, open-source tools for image conversion without
memory overhead). Also, it does not currently run on Windows although
you could certainly be the one to patch that. See the README for that 
plugin for details.

=== Enabling the FCK Editor ===

In your `apps/frontend/config/settings.yml`:

    all:
      .settings:
        rich_text_fck_js_dir: apostrophePlugin/js/fckeditor

This installation of FCK is already set up nicely for reasonable editing of rich text blurbs without too many distracting features enabled. You can use another if you wish.

=== Installing Zend Search ===

Zend Search is a little bit less painless. You'll need to install a
portion of the Zend framework in your Symfony project, or install
Zend globally on your system. One solution is to
install the complete Zend framework, or just the minimal version
(which does include Zend_Search),  in lib/vendor/Zend. If you do so
you'll need to add the following line of code to
the `setup` method of your `ProjectConfiguration` class:

    set_include_path(
      sfConfig::get('sf_lib_dir') .
        '/vendor' . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());

If you install the Zend framework globally on your system,
then you won't need to make any changes
to your `ProjectConfiguration` class.

=== Configuring Apache ===

The media plugin uses carefully designed URLs to allow images to be
served as static files after they are generated for the first time. This
is done at the Apache level to maximize performance: PHP (and therefore
Symfony) don't have to get involved at all after the first time an image
is rendered at a particular size.

The following special .htaccess rules are required to enable this. These
should be copied to your .htaccess file after the 
`RewriteBase /` rule, if you are using one, but before any other rules. 
Note that in version 0.5 the media files have moved to a subfolder
of the `/uploads` folder, which simplifies configuration for you because
that directory is already writable by the web server in any new
Symfony project.

    ###### BEGIN special handling for the media module's cached scaled images
    # If it exists, just deliver it
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/uploads/media_items/.+$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
    RewriteRule .* - [L]
    # If it doesn't exist, render it via the front end controller
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/uploads/media_items/.+$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
    ###### END special handling for the media module's cached scaled images

Please note that if you don't do this, you'll get "404 Not Found" errors for 
your images.

=== Creating Writable Data Folders ===

Finally, you'll need to create the data/a_writable folder and make it
world writable if you are operating in a typical hosting environment
in which Apache (and therefore PHP) otherwise can't write to files:

    data/a_writable

Your web/uploads folder must also be writable, which is true by default
in new Symfony projects. 

=== Security Decisions ===

Who will be able to upload media to your site? And who will be able to
delete and edit media belonging to others? 

*By default, any authenticated user can upload media.* If you specify a
specific credential required for upload privileges by setting
`app_apostrophePlugin_upload_credential`, then only users with that
credential will be allowed to upload media. 

Users can always edit media originally uploaded by them. To edit
media uploaded by others, you must have the `media_admin` credential.
You can change the name of this credential by setting
`app_apostrophePlugin_admin_credential`.

=== Enabling the aMedia Module ===

You'll need to enable the aMedia module in your application. This is
necessary both for the front-end user interface and to enable access
to the API and the use of images.

=== Routing Rules ===

By default, the aMedia plugin provides routing rules that ensure
images can be accessed dynamically when they are first requested, and
later accessed directly as a static file as the same URL. You probably
won't want to disable these, but if you do, you can turn this 
feature off by setting app_aMedia_defaultrouting to false. If you
do turn these routing rules off, be sure to check out `lib/aMediaRouting.php` 
to see exactly what you're disabling.

That's it for configuration. Let's check out what this plugin can do.

== Browsing and Managing Media ==

To access the media plugin's user interface, just enable the
aMedia module in your project and visit the aMedia/index action.

If you are logged in as the `sfGuard` superuser or otherwise have
full credentials, you'll see buttons to add images and video.

Click "add images" to upload photos to the site. Notice that you
can click "Add Another Photo" to add up to five more browse buttons.
After you upload your images you'll be prompted for metadata like
the title, description and tags. Tags should be separated by commas.

Once you have added photos, you'll see them in the index page.
You can filter the index by tag and search it for any text that
appears in the title or description using Zend search.

You can also edit and delete items in context using the edit
and delete buttons. 

Since videos are hosted by YouTube (or other services when
embed_codes is enabled) and not directly hosted by the
plugin, adding video works a little bit differently. When you add
a video you'll be invited to search YouTube to locate that video.
If you prefer you can also paste in the YouTube URL of the video directly.

== The Embed Code Option ==

If `app_aMedia_embed_codes` is enabled via `app.yml` you can also
paste in embed codes for other sites using a third option that appears
when adding videos.

The embed feature does filter
irrelevant tags and text, but does not attempt to remove all
attributes, since so many are necessary when embedding. That means
that users could paste in unwanted JavaScript handlers or style
attributes. So you may or may not wish to enable it. By default 
it is turned off.

The embed feature requires you to supply a thumbnail image manually
at the same time you supply the embed code. This is not necessary
when using a YouTube URL. When you can, use YouTube.

== The Select Action: Selecting Media ==

Many web applications will want to embed images and video that
reside in the media plugin. apostrophePlugin offers a simple way
to invite users to select media. 

To invite the user to select a single media item, just 
send them to `http://yoursite/media/select` with the following
additional parameters in the query string:

* `after` is the URL the user should be sent back to after they
make their selection or decide to cancel.
* `type` is optional. If present it should be either `image` or
`video`. It restricts the user's selection to one specific type of
media, making it less confusing for them to browse.
* `aMediaIds`, used for multiple selections only, is a comma-separated 
list of media item IDs that should already be selected when the user begins.
* The optional `multiple` parameter, when set to 1, indicates that the user 
should be allowed to select more than one media item and put them in their
preferred order. This is great for creating slideshows.

The user will be prompted to select an item, or to select one or more items.
In the case of a multiple selection the user is permitted to drag and drop
their selected items into a particular order before confirming their
selection.

Once the user has made their selection they are sent to 
the `after` URL, which receives an additional GET-method parameter,
`aMediaIds`, containing a comma-separated list of media IDs. In this 
way you can very easily enable the user to select media without creating
a new user interface of your own.

The following optional parameters limit the plugin to displaying only
images with the specified characteristics during selection:

* When you pass `width` and `height`, only images with those exact
dimensions will be displayed.

* When you pass `minimum-width` and-or `minimum-height`, only images
with dimensions meeting those minimum criteria will be displayed.

* When you pass `aspect-width` and `aspect_height`, only images
with the specified aspect ratio will be displayed (example: passing
aspect-width=4 and aspect-height=3 displays only images with
a 4x3 aspect ratio). This is a powerful option because there is
usually no real need to require a fixed size due to the automatic
resizing capabilities of the plugin. Instead, specify the aspect
ratio and, to ensure adequate quality, specify the minimum width and height.

Finally, the `label` parameter is useful to display a subheading
to the user reminding them what they are looking for and why
(for instance, "Create a Slideshow"). The `label` parameter may not
contain HTML markup, only plaintext is permitted.

For full-fledged examples see the aMediaSlideshow, aMediaVideo
and aMediaImage slot implementations. Specifically, check out their 
_normalView.php templates to see how to build these URLs elegantly and 
painlessly.

== The REST API: Fetching Information About Media ==

The select action gives you back a media ID, or a list of them. But
what good are they? Well, not much... until you use the REST API to
find out the details.

Yes, we could have packed this information into the URL. But URLs
are limited in size both by browser limitations and by the strong
preference of many developers. And the API provides a more flexible
way to pass detailed information.

*The quickest way to obtain information about media IDs is to use
the methods provided in the aMediaAPI class*, which is intended
for use in Symfony applications and makes it very easy to 
fetch the data. Here I'll explain in a bit more detail so that
you understand what is going on and so that non-Symfony and
non-PHP programmers can take advantage of the API.

To obtain information about media items, just pass zero or more of 
To find out everything you need to know about a media ID, or a
string of IDs separated by commas,
just take advantage of PHP's built-in support for accessing URLs
(most other languages can do this too). Note that in rare cases
PHP might not be built with support for URLs in file-related functions.
In such cases you may be able to use the cURL functions instead:

    $response = file_get_contents(
      "http://yourmediasite/media/info?" .
      http_build_query(
        "apikey" => $apikey,
        "aMediaIds" => $ids,
        "user" => $username));

You can also use the POST method to ensure you do not hit the URL length limit
(hint: see the aMediaAPI class for an example of how to do this in PHP without the need for cURL).

Note that you may pass an api key, which must be listed
under app_aMedia_apikeys unless app_aMedia_apipublic is set to true:

    aMedia:
      apikeys:
        - 'anystringyouchoose'
      apipublic: false

After this call, `$response` will contain a JSON response from the
media plugin. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a simple
interchange format for passing data, including objects, between
programs written in many different languages including PHP.

To decode the response, just write:

    $response = json_decode($response);

Then make sure the response is valid:

    if (is_object($response) && ($response->status === 'ok'))
    {
      // We got a good reply
    }

Now you can check out `$response->result`, which will contain an object
array with two properties, `total` and `items`. `total` contains the total number
of items matching the criteria you provided, while `items` contains the 
actual items returned. If your browsing criteria were excessively broad,
or if you explicitly specified the `offset` and `limit` criteria, you may
receive fewer items than indicated by `total`.

The `items` array is made up of objects with `title`, `description`, `type`, `id`, 
`embed`, `image`, `originalImage`, `width`, `serviceUrl` and `height` 
properties.

`ids` is not the only criterion you can pass. You can pass any of the 
following (or pass no criteria at all to match all items):

tag
search
type (video or image)
aspect-width and aspect-height (returns only images with the specified aspect ratio)
minimum-width
minimum-height
width
height 
ids (a comma-separated string of numeric item IDs)
offset
limit

The `offset` and `limit` parameters work just as they do in SQL. To fetch beginning from the first item, specify an offset of zero (or do not specify an offset at all). To skip the first ten items, specify an offset of 10. To fetch ten items, specify a limit of 10.

If the `search` parameter is present, items are returned in descending order of relevance. If the `ids` parameter is present, items are returned in the order specified in `ids`. Otherwise, items are returned in newest-first order.

The aMediaAPI class can be used to take advantage of the API conveniently from a Symfony application. Note that when using the aMediaAPI class you should set the location and apikey of the media server via the following app.yml settings:

    aMedia:
      # When acting as a client, we need to know where the 
      # media site is. If you don't set this, it is assumed
      # that the media server is on the same site, and 
      # the query API does not request absolute URLs when
      # asking for info about media items
  
      # client_site: "http://www.mymediasite.com/"
  
      # when acting as a client, we need an api key that
      # is on the server's apikeys list. When the server and
      # client are the same site, just make sure the key you
      # have here is also the (only?) key listed for apikeys
      client_apikey: 'dummy'

See `aMediaAPI.class.php` for more information (TODO: document this better).

=== Embedding Images and Videos In Your Application ===

The `embed`, `image` and `originalImage` properties contain ready-to-use URLs,
intended to embed the media item in your site. For an image, the embed tag
will be an `img` tag; for a video it will be the usual
YouTube embed tag. In both cases, you'll want to replace
certain placeholders with the width, height, cropping style and 
file format you actually want. This is very easy to do with `str_replace`:

    echo(str_replace(
      array("_WIDTH_", "_HEIGHT_", "_c-OR-s_", "_FORMAT_"),
      array(320, 240, 'c', 'jpg'),
      $response->result[$i]->embed));

A note on the cropping styles: `c` crops just the largest central portion of
the image that fits in the aspect ratio you have specified, while 
`s` scales the entire image into the box specified, with a white border
to fill it out to the aspect ratio. Images are never stretched.
Videos do not support cropping styles and will quietly ignore them;
The YouTube player will be of the size you specify. 

To embed the image or video with a constant width but a flexible height
that depends on its aspect ratio, just compute the height on the fly:

   $width, ($width / $item->width) * $item->height, ...

You can also easily enable users to access the original image in its
full size and original format. To do that, just use 
`$item->originalImage` as the `src` attribute of an `img` element
or the `href` element of an `a` element, depending on whether you want
to enable them to view it directly or download it (the latter probably
being best for large originals).

Since videos do not actually reside in the media plugin you cannot 
download the original video file. For videos, the `originalImage`
property points to a thumbnail image of the video, which is quite
useful because it is often the right thing to show in code that
does not specifically support video.

The `image` property is similar, but while it is just a URL
like `originalImage`, it does contain the placeholders for
width, height, cropping style and format, allowing you to str_replace
those with values appropriate to your application. For videos,
this property points to a copy of the preferred, largest available still image 
of the video, which is mirrored in the media plugin for convenience.
Note that this means you can safely use it to display a still
image of any media object without worrying about whether
it's a video or a photograph.

Videos also have the `serviceUrl` property, which points directly to the
official YouTube page for the video.

== Cached Media Access ==

Web sites scale images to a variety of styles and crop them in differing
ways. However, good performance demands that images be served from static files
whenever possible. And the URLs of images should ideally be meaningful and
recognizable. apostrophePlugin seeks to meet all of these requirements.

apostrophePlugin generates a "slug" for every
image. The slug is the title the user gives the image when uploading
it, with characters that are
problematic in URLs removed, and a unique integer added if necessary 
to make sure the slug is unique among all images. Once generated the
slug does not change.

apostrophePlugin then automatically satisfies requests for URLs of
the following form:

    /uploads/media_items/SLUG.WIDTH.HEIGHT.[c or s].jpg

That is, a URL like this:

    /uploads/media_items/monkey.100.100.c.jpg

Will automatically generate a 100x100 image which is cropped and scaled
down from the largest central part of the original having the same
aspect ratio as the request (thus the c in the URL). 

A URL like this:

    /uploads/media_items/monkey.100.100.s.jpg

Will produce an image that contains every pixel in the original, scaled
to the desired dimensions, with whitespace padding added on the
smaller axis if necessary to avoid distortion.

Of course, if the plugin generated these images anew on every request,
the performance would be terrible. And even simply redelivering existing 
cached copies of the images via Symfony code would be a large performance hit. 
So instead the plugin writes them to the actual `web/uploads/media_items` folder on 
your site. And with the Apache configuration rules shown earlier in this 
document, those static images will automatically be re-delivered in the
future... *without Symfony being invoked at all*. The performance
benefits are enormous.

== On Security ==

There are three levels of access to the media plugin:

* Browsing media. Everyone can do this. Of course, you could change that via
`security.yml` rules.

* Uploading media. By default, everyone can do this. If you set
`app_aMedia_upload_credential`, then only users with that
Symfony credential will be able to upload media. The user who uploaded
a media item can also edit that item.

* Administering media. By default, only users with the
credential `media_admin` can edit and delete media that
were uploaded by others. You can change this by setting
`app_aMedia_admin_credential` to a different value.

== About Video Support ==

We didn't try to reinvent the video management wheel. That would be difficult,
expensive and ultimately unsatisfying due to the huge scope of the problem
legally, technically and financially. Instead we leveraged YouTube.

Users can search for YouTube videos directly from the media plugin's
user interface, adding them to your local media repository much as they
would still images. But the actual videos remain on YouTube and are
embedded via YouTube embed tags. This strategy is simple, free and
highly effective. It does 95% of what you'd like to do with video
at 5% of the cost. Naive code can treat the video as it would treat
a still image and get similar results.

== If It Doesn't Seem to Work ==

Read the installation section again. Twice. (: The Apache `.htaccess`
rules are important. So are the writable folders.

== TODO ==

Since we're generating embed tags on your behalf we really ought to
help you pass additional parameters to YouTube in order to influence
the behavior of the player.
